**📖 The Story**

I am a Solo Developer driven by a **profound interest in Android System Development**. What started as curiosity about Android's limits has evolved into a mission to give devices a "second life" through deep optimization and firmware modding. For me, it is not merely about writing code; it is about pushing hardware beyond its factory boundaries.

## Personal Stuffs:

- 🚀 **Focus:** Build and porting
- 🌱 **Learning:** Strategically acquiring skills to meet current project demands.
- ✨ **Interests:** Embedded Systems, Reverse Engineering, Kernel Development.
- 📱 **Official Maintaining:** PixelLines and EunoiaOS
